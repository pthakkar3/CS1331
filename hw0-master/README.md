Homework 0 is designed to introduce students to:
- Text editors
- Writing a simple Java program
- Compiling and running a Java program
- Understanding errors
- The submission process

The instructions are located in the file `index.md`. It is recommended to view the instructions on the github.gatech.edu webpage as opposed to locally (becuase the web version is much easier to read than the plain text file).
